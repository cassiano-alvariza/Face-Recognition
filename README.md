# Face-Recognition
This is my first project, a facial recognition made entirely with python, using the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries. I plan on using this to create a FaceID for Windows and post it here. This project is simple, but requires good performing hardware, because of the face-recognition library (based on Dlib). Please, read the README file. Thanks!
