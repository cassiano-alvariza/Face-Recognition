# Face-Recognition
This is my first project, a facial recognition made entirely with python, using the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries. I plan on using this to create a FaceID for Windows and post it here. This project is simple, but requires good performing hardware, because of the face-recognition library (based on Dlib).


This project is simple, in code and in its usability.
You need to have a file with pictures of the people you want to recognize via webcam in order for it to work, but, in case you just want to test it,
there is a file (facerec) with some famous people for you to show a picture of them on your webcam and try it out for yourself.

Do not forget to cd the directory that you will run the program, as it needs facerec to be in the same directory as the other files.

You will need:
- Python 3.8 or later  
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
- numpy
